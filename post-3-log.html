have their own layouts, and I fixed the next/prev
of posts. PHP arrays are actually primitive values,
so they always get copied around, which is unexpected
because in most other languages, arrays are references.</p>
<p>The codebase is getting crappier by the days.
Well, since I'm dealing with PHP here it's expected
to have warts and all, like accidentally adding an $
to a function name.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter anyway, as long as I get all
the necessary features of a static site generator.
I could work on the code quality much later when
I invested an inordinate amount of time using it
and have created plenty of content.</p></div>            </div>
