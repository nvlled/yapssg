It's mostly raining today, I heard there was a typhoon maybe.
Hopefully, it doesn't flood again. I feel extra lethargic
on rainy days, but at the same time I'd like to ride a bike
outside while it's raining, then have a warm coffee afterwards.
Then I'd lie down on a shitty couch and watch that strange 
german series about a time-travelling cave.
