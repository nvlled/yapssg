I made few changes again. I let categories
have their own layouts, and I fixed the next/prev 
of posts. PHP arrays are actually primitive values,
so they always get copied around, which is unexpected
because in most other languages, arrays are references.

The codebase is getting crappier by the days.
Well, since I'm dealing with PHP here it's expected
to have warts and all, like accidentally adding an $
to a function name.

It doesn't matter anyway, as long as I get all 
the necessary features of a static site generator.
I could work on the code quality much later when
I invested an inordinate amount of time using it
and have created plenty of content.
