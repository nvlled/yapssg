Greetings. This is a minimal, zero depedency static site general in PHP.
You just write normal PHP, then deploy to static HTML when your done.
No fancy tooling, it's all in the bin folder.

Big caveat, I wrote this out of frustration on existing 
overcomplicated SSGs that fails unexpectedly for no reason.
I wrote this for personal use. For strange use-cases that I didn't
have in mind, it may result in unexpected consequences.
