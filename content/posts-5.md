I've added almost all the things I listed in the [last post](posts-4),
except for tagging and rss feed, but I should do that much later
when I actually have some written content to organize and publish...

On side note, writing mix PHP and HTML code sure is a PITA.
Formatters help, but it still looks quite an unreadable mess.
Some formatters even format the indents unexpectedly.
But compared to dealing with custom crippled templates
and the complexity it adds, it doesn't seem that bad.

The nice thing about writing directly in PHP is that
I can implement features at whim. Sure the code
looks crap, and probably has a lot of bugs, but 
the worst thing can happen is that it emits
broken HTML content, which is quite easy to notice.

It's a whole lot another case if I was writing a 
backend with a database though.
