Hopefully, it doesn't flood again. I feel extra lethargic
on rainy days, but at the same time I'd like to ride a bike
outside while it's raining, then have a warm coffee afterwards.
Then I'd lie down on a shitty couch and watch that strange
german series about a time-travelling cave.</p></div>            </div>
